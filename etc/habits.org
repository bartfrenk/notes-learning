* Week 3 (max 5)
** Create a plan before starting each working day
Run =open-plan= to open the plan.org file.
** Use C-c RET f e to create function from example in Clojure mode 
** Use b/B and w/W to navigate a single line
** Make use of marks and jumps to navigate file
The combination m <key> sets a mark in normal mode, the combination ' <key>
jumps to that mark.
** Use g r to refresh the magit buffer
* Soon
** Use sesman-restart to restart the Clojure REPL
Is there a better way to deal with new dependencies?
* Later
