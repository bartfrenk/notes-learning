* Keybindings
- <2018-05-17>: % jumps to matching bracket
- <2018-06-01>: d2w deletes the next two words
- Use R to enter overwrite mode
- Use W to move a word forward
- evil surround cs"' changes "Hello world!" to 'Hello world!"
- shift-V selects full lines of text
- ctrl-V enters visual block mode (use arrows to select block)
- ysis" surrounds sentence with "s
- ds" removes the quotes
- --> surround mode: y to add, c to change, d to delete
- W moves the entire word
- ; repeats the previous character search (e.g., f)
- mx sets mark 'x', 'x jumps to mark 'x'; lower-case marks are buffer-local,
  upper case marks are global.
- Ctrl-Tab cycles through Firefox tabs!
- Use g r to refresh the magit buffer
- <prefix> q kills the magit buffers (just q only buries them alive)
- C-<up>, C-<down> jump between paragraphs of text
- C-J inserts a new-line in a smart way
- C-K deletes a line
- *Clojure*: C-c C-m hh list all available clj-refactor refactorings, e.g.
  - C-c C-m cn cleans up namespace form
  - C-c C-m ef extracts a function
- ysiw" surrounds word part with ", change w to W to surround full word
- In helm-find-files, press C-u C-c o to open the file in the other window. It
  seems that C-c o is standard behaviour, however, there seems to be something
  wrong with my setup. See also [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm/issues/1874][this]] Helm issue.
- C-c SPC vertically aligns maps and sorts in Clojure mode (e.g. try in deps.edn)
- C-h e jumps to the message buffer
- move to delimiting parenthesis ]), or [( to jump back. Similarly, for } and {
- ]] jumps syntactic elements, and [[ jumps back.
