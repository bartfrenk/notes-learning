** CANCELED Introduction To The Course
CLOSED: [2018-11-04 Sun 21:36]
** CANCELED AWS - 10,000 Feet Overview
CLOSED: [2018-11-04 Sun 21:36]
** DONE Identity Access Management (IAM)
CLOSED: [2018-11-04 Sun 21:36]
** STARTED AWS Object Storage and CDN - S3, Glacier and CloudFront
*** 101

*Miscellaneous*

- Files can 0 B to 5 TB.
- S3 is a universal namespace. That is names must be unique globally.
- https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/acloudguru.
- HTTP 200 code when upload was successful.

*Data Consistency Model for S3*

- Read after write consistency for PUTS of new objects
- Eventual consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES (can take some time to
  propagate).
  
Objects consist of the following:
- Key: the name
- Value: the contents
- Version ID
- Metadata
- Subresources
  - Access Control Lists
  - Torrent (beyond the scope of the course)

*Storage tiers*
- S3 standard
- S3 - IA (Infrequently accessed). Retrieval fee.
- S3 One Zone - IA (Infrequently accessed, stored in one Availability Zone).
- Glacier (lowest cost, but long retrieval time) 
  
*Charged for*
- Storage
- Requests
- Storage management pricing (charged for the tags)
- Data transfer pricing (cross-region replication)
- Transfer acceleration

*Tips*
**** POSTPONED Read the S3 FAQ before taking the exam. It comes up a LOT!

*** DONE Version control (lab)
CLOSED: [2018-11-04 Sun 23:08]
**** Exam tips
- Stores all versions of an object (including all writes and even if you delete
  an object)
- Great backup tool
- Once enabled, versioning cannot be disabled, only suspended
- Integrates with lifecycle rules  
- Can use MFA Delete capability which uses multi-factor authentication, can be
  used to provide an additional layer of security.
*** DONE Cross-region replication (lab)
CLOSED: [2018-11-04 Sun 23:08]
**** Exam tips
- Versioning must be enabled on both the source and destination buckets.
- Regions must be unique.
- Files in an existing bucket are not replicated automatically. All subsequent
  updated files will be replicated automatically.
- You cannot replicate to multiple buckets or use daisy chaining (at this time).
- Delete markers are replicated.
- Deleting individual versions or delete markers will not be replicated.
- Understand what cross-region replication is at high level.
*** DONE Lifecycle management S3-IA & Glacier Lab
CLOSED: [2018-11-04 Sun 23:08]
**** Exam tips
- Can be used in conjunction with versioning
- CAn be applied to current versions and previous versions
- Following actions can now be done
  - Transition to the standard - Infrequent Access Storage Class
  - Archive to the Glacier Storage Class
  - Permanently delete
*** DONE CloudFront CDN overview
CLOSED: [2018-11-04 Sun 23:08]
*** DONE Create a CloudFront CDN - Lab
CLOSED: [2018-11-04 Sun 23:08]
*** DONE Security and encryption
CLOSED: [2018-11-05 Mon 22:37]
- In transit (SSL/TLS)
- At rest
  - server side encryption
    - S3 managed keys - SSE-S3 (AES-256)
    - AWS key management service, managed keys - SSE-KMS
      - Provides an audit trail
    - Server side encryption with customer provided keys - SSE-C
- Client side encryption
  - Encrypt and upload
*** DONE Storage gateway
CLOSED: [2018-11-05 Mon 22:41]
Can be a popular exam topic. Connects an on-premise software appliance with
cloud-based storage.
- File gateway (NFS): flat files in S3
- Volume gateway (iSCSI): block storage
  - Stored volumes
  - Cached volumes
- Tape gateway (VTL)
*** Snowball
- Snowball: storage capacity
- Snowball edge: storage capacity and compute
- Snowmobile
**** Exam tips
- Understand what snowball is
- Understand what import/export is
- Snowball can:
  - import to S3
  - export from S3
*** Transfer acceleration  
*** Create a static website using S3
URL: <bucket-name>-website-<region>.amazonaws.com
** EC2 - The Backbone of AWS
*** EC2 101
Nice tip: Use magnetic storage for dev and test environments
*** Security groups basics
Any inbound rules also apply outbound

** Route53
** Applicatin Services
** The Real World - Creating a fault tolerant Word Press Site
** The Well Architected Framework
** Additional Exam Tips
