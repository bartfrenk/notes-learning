* Notes
** Chapter 1. Escaping monolithic hell
Adrian Cockcroft, formerly of Netflix, defines a microservices architecture as a
service-oriented architecture composed of loosely coupled elements that have
bounded contexts. (p. 7)

There is a discussion on microservice pattern languages that might be useful.
