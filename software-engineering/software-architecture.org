* Monitoring

To monitor your EC2 servers completely, you need two additional things:
- A server/operating-system monitor that monitors the OS and the server from
  within the server. This provides information such as memory utilization,
  swapping, and filesystem usage.
- An application performance monitoring solution that monitors your application
  from within the application. This will provide information about how the
  application is performing, how users are using the application, and
  information on errors and problems that occur within the software.  Only with
  all three of these monitoring capabilities (the previous two and CloudWatch)
  can you consider an EC2 server completely monitored. [1] (p. 169)
