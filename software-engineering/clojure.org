This becomes part of the standard library in clojure 1.9.

** Style guide (bbatsov)
   - Prefer function pre and post conditions to checks inside a function's body,
   - Don't shadow clojure.core names with local bindings.
   - Good (< 5 x 10)
   - To access a private var (e.g. for testing), use the @#'some.ns/var form.
   - However, when defining sets, only use literal syntax when the values are
     compile-time constants. [link]

   - Consider wrapping all I/O calls with the io! macro to avoid nasty surprises
     if you accidentally end up calling such code in a transaction.

   - Tag the annotation with your initials and a date so its relevance can be
     easily verified.
