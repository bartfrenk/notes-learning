** DONE Kapteijn's tutorial on how to use streaming bandit
   CLOSED: [2018-03-09 Fri 11:13]
   This is [1].
** WAIT Good tutorial on Thompson sampling
   This is [2].

   On wait because the chapter on sampling is not easily read for someone
   without background. It is recommended to read the chapter on sampling from
   Bishop first.

   There are particularly interesting examples in the paper, that are worth
   studying carefully.
