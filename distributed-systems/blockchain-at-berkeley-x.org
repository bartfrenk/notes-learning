Byzantine general's problem.

Nodes communicate via message passing:
1. Messages may be lost
2. Nodes may misbehave maliciously.

*Proposition.* Consensus is not possible when 1/3 or more of all nodes are
malicious, e.g., consider the case of 3 nodes with 1 malicious node.

A solution to come to consensus with less than 1/3 malicious nodes is outlined
in the paper Liskov ea. /Practical Byzantine fault tolerance/ (1990).

Types of faults:
1. Fail-stop. Nodes can crash or not return values, crash detectable by other
   nodes.
2. Byzantine. Nodes can do all of the above and send incorrect
   values. Corruption and manipulation harder to detect.
*** Voting based consensus

Paper by Miguel Castro and Barbara Liskov.

BTF-NS only 3% slower than just BTF.
*** DONE Nakamoto consensus
CLOSED: [2018-12-07 Fri 12:16]
- Voting based consensus: explicit votes
- Nakamoto consensus: implicit voted based on a random lottery.
  - Fork resolution policy
Examples:
- Proof of work: miners
- Proof of stake: validators
*** Proof of stake
Interesting link: Tendermint (BFT based consensus)
** Enterprise blockchain: real-world applications
** Scaling blockchain: cryptocurrencies for the masses
** Regulation and anonymity
** A blockchain-powered future
